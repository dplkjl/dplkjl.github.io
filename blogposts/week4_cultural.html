				<h1>Week 4 Cultural Blog</h1>
				<div class="body">
					<p>The 'problem facing the tech world' that I am choosing to examine in this blog, is the difficulty in completing large
					IT projects on time and within budget.  I am particularly interested in this from NZ point of view.  Recently in the news, we
					have seen issues with Novopay, the education payroll system, but prior to that there was the NZ Police, INCIS project, and a number of others
					as well.<br>
					<br>
					An article by  Michael Bloch, Sven Blumberg and Jurgen Laartz entitled 'Delivering large-scale IT projects on time, on budget and on value'
					(http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/delivering_large-scale_it_projects_on_time_on_budget_and_on_value)
					describes the issues relating to very large IT projects.</p>
					<blockquote>				
					Our research, conducted in collaboration with the University of Oxford, suggests that half of all large IT projects—defined as those with initial price tags exceeding $15 million—massively blow their budgets. On average, large IT projects run 45 percent over budget 
					and 7 percent over time, while delivering 56 percent less value than predicted. Software projects run the highest risk of cost and schedule overruns.</blockquote><br>
					<br>

					<p>While the size of the projects in NZ may be much smaller the basic risks to the Government or private companies undertaking such projects is equally great. The failure of the INCIS project in 1999 lead to a good deal of analysis of the issues around the project and lead to a number of reports, and the development of government standards and recommendations relating to IT projects.<br>
					<br>

					The analysis of INCIS which is undoubtedly true of Novopay and other such IT 'failures' found shortcomings in terms of unrealistic expectations, the use of	unproven and inadequately tested technology, bad management and leadership, scope creep and just sheer size and complexity.  As this quote from a University of	Canterbury article (http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/research/reports/TechReps/2002/tr_0202.pdf) states:<br>
					<br></p>
					<blockquote>
					While having some unique characteristics, the INCIS fiasco showed many of 
					the traits of the typical failed IS project. These included highly overblown 
					expectations regarding IS; the attempted development of new and unproven 
					technology; management and reporting problems; a naive faith in contracts to control 
					development and seek redress when things went wrong; and increasing the complexity 
					of the project through specification changes and organisational restructuring.</blockquote><br>
					<br>

					<p>These large projects are huge and complex and have a long development and implementation cycle.  In my view, the most useful strategy to improve the success rate of such projects
					is to break them down into smaller modular chunks that can be more quickly and easily managed and implemented.  In addition, in the NZ context, it allows local developers to 
					take part and have some ownership of the development.  Smaller nimble companies can provide cost effective, timely outputs at a low risk and with the benefit of supporting local
					employment and workforce development.</p>
