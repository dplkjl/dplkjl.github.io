				<h1>Balance</h1>
				<div class="body">
					<p>I've chosen to write a couple of sentences about 'balance'.  What I mean by balance as a value is being open and embracing a wide range of values and avoiding extremes.  Happiness and wellbeing come from a balanced view of yourself and the world you live in.  It is about accepting the things that you can't change and working to change things that you have some influence over.  It is about respect for yourself and others. It is about considering things and acting in a appropriate proportional way.  It is about empathy but on the other hand holding strong on your own views.  The world would be a better place with more balance and less extremes, more pragmatism and less absolutism. </p> 
				</div>

				<h1>Advice</h1>
				<div class="body">
					<p>The last advice that I was asked for was by my partner asking my view on a work related issue. It involved how to deal with a company who was underperforming in delivering a service and how best to approach resolving the issue. </p> 
				</div>								
				<h1>Values and Stereotype threat</h1>
				<div class="body">
					<p>Absolutely, understanding your values and being self aware will assist you in dealing with stereotype threat.  If you know which areas of your identity are likely to trigger your self sabotage mechanisms and then can minimise those by internally referring to your values, you should be in a better position to control the threat.  If you know what is important to you and why then you can begin to rationalise the stereotype threat that you experience.  It can also help you empathise with others who may potentially react in a way that suggests they are experiencing their own stereotype threat.</p> 
					<p>Other strategies for raising your spirits if you begin to feel low during the EDA bootcamp might include taking a break, doing an activity involving fun and friends or seeking support from external support people. A bit of movie escapism or a good sleep.  Go out with friends, do some exercise or whatever makes you forget about work for a bit.</p>
