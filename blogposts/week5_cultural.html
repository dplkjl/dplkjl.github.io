				<h1>Pairing</h1>
				<div class="body">
				<h2> One Emotion!</h2>
				<p>'Awkwardness'.  That is the one emotion that stands out for me.  The awkwardness of working with someone you have not met personally
				and know very little about. Someone who is a bit of a mystery, you don't know about their experience, knowledge or personality. The awkwardness of relating via the internet.  No body language or facial expressions to read.  The awful delay in remote sharing, that second or two delay can lead
				to difficult communication.  The awkwardness of not wanting to appear foolish but also not wanting to appear a 'know-it-all'.  Just awkward!
				</p>
				<p>I haven't had much opportunity to pair yet.  The C# stream is quite small and all at different stages.  Pairing hasn't been a high priority as
				we all try to get on top of the content.  I did a face to face session that was far more satisfying and helpful than the hangout sessions.  It was more satisfying, helpful and productive.</p>
				<h2> Kind Actionable and Specific Feedback</h2>
				<p>Respect is at the root of all good feedback.  If you respond to your pair in a respectful manner you will met the required principles of EDA pairing. The principles require our feedback to each other to be kind.  This means framing your response in a way that is designed to support and encourage without negativity or sharpness.  It should be considered and measured, in a tone that you would want to have others address you. </p>
				<p>Actionable feedback means that you are able to actually do something as a result of the feedback.  If the feedback relates to something you have no control over then it is not actionable.  The recipient should be able to follow through with your advice or feedback and actually make a change as a result of receiving it.  It needs to be specific and do-able.</p>
				<h2>My experience of Feedback</h2>
				<p> The lack of pairing has resulted in a lack of feedback.  In fact, no feedback!  However, I can give myself some feedback.  My feedback to myself is relax and just go with it!  Try to stick more with the navigator/driver scenario.  Also take your time.  I find the stimuli from multiple sources similtaneously a bit overwhelming.  Typing, thinking all at the same time is hard!  </p>
				<p>Writing feedback was a bit challenging.  It was difficult to come up with any actionable and specific to help my pair.  It is something that I will have to work on.  I found I didn't have much to contribute.</p>
				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p> I am a bit ambivalent about pairing in the very formal way that is prescribed in the course.  I would prefer a less formal situation where we 
				were just able to share and teach each other.  I think it is good to have it prescribed so that we do work with a wide group of different individuals.  The tendency would be to spend time with the people you connect best with, which does not necessarily replicate the work environment.</p>
