    <h1>Sunday 8th June 2014</h1>
    <h1>Kitchen vs Table Video Response </h1>
    Whoa!  The video has both comforted and scared me witless in equal measures. The EDA experience is clearly designed to be totally immersive in a way that I hadn't fully grasped.  Particularly, I hadn't investigated sufficiently to understand how intensive the preparation phase was going to be. Consequently, this first week has been a shock!  The sheer volume of work required has me reeling a bit.
 	<br>
 	<br>
	Having just finished watching the video at mid day on Sunday, I think I probably need time to assimilate it and let it all sink in. There simply isn't time.  Which is a bit of a metaphor for the experience so far.  
 	<br>
 	<br>	
	A lot of what Shareef said very much resonates with me. I like the inclusive approach, the valuing of all perspectives, the team philosophy and view that it is the relationships with people that is the greater part of being a successful programmer. I found the questions about handling time pressures, workload and learning styles very reassuring. 
 	<br>
  	<br>	
	I'll be getting my family to watch the video so that they have some understanding of the philosophy and reason why I will be absent mentally if not physically over the next 3 months.
	<br>
 	<br>
	As a more 'mature' participant, I have some insecurities about how I fit this intensive experience into my life. I wonder if my energy levels will cope with the intensity and whether my brain is nimble enough to hold all the new learning.  So my determination is to go with the process, stay as open as possible, take whatever I can from the experience and hope that my experience is useful to others.
	The experience will be a real personal challenge and I am really looking forward to that aspect.  I am quite focussed about what I want to get out of it.
