    <h1> Google</h1>
    <p> This web site is the front end for a search engine.  As discussed in my Technical Blog, it is probably the most visited web site in existence.  It needed to be super simple to use, universally understood and fast to load. The visual challenge is around simplicity and clarity.  The user needs to be able to visit without becoming distracted and irritated.  It needs to be completely intuitative, uncluttered and fresh. The frequency with which a customer might visit the site means the design must not be a visual deterrent. Thankfully the Google business model has also avoided the use of advertising. </p>
    <br>
    <h1> Dwell Housing Trust</h1>
    <p> This web site needs to clearly provide information about the organisation and invite both potential clients and supporters into the site. The audience is broken into three groups, those who might be seeking service from the organisation, others who wish to support the organisation and finally third party visitors who are seeking information about community housing. 
    <br>
    The visual challenge is to entice the visitor into the site to inspect the information within.  It also needs to present a positive professional image of the organisation and present easily accessible contact details.  The site is visually attractive, largely achieved by using some well select images right up front. 
    </p>
    <br>
      <h1> w3Schools</h1>
    <p> This web page needs to present a lot of technical detail information in a well organised and attractive fashion.  It needs to be clear and easily navigated.  There needs to be a limited number of clicks for users to get in and out of the detail that they are seeking.
    <br>    
    The visual challenge is to present the information in a clear uncluttered fashion.  The use of attractive fonts and plenty of white space, minimal colour and clear graphics support this approach.
