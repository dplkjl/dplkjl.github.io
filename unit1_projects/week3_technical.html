    <strong>Why Choose JavaScript!</strong></h1>
    <h2> What is JavaScript</h2>
    JavaScript is an object oriented language used in the creation of web pages. It is used to create 'functions' that are embedded in HTML pages. It is has a syntax that is similar to C and uses names identical to Java, but it is different from both.<br>
    <br>
    JavaScript is well established and very popular as a web programming language.<br>
    <h2>Why is Javascript popular in web development?</h2>
	JavaScript is reputedly easy to learn and easy to use. I haven't had a chance yet to evaluate this for myself. My knowledge of
	alternatives is also very limited.  However, it's widespread use certainly suggests this is true.<br><br>
	
	There are a lot of built in functions and functionality that makes scripting 'effortless'. In other words JavaScript provides some
	extra bits that extend the things that it can do.  Some processes have been made easier because of these extra bits.  This saves you time
	and makes developing your customised web site requirements quicker and easier.<br><br>
	<em>	"JavaScript is one of the most simple, versatile and effective languages used to extend functionality in websites. Uses range from on screen visual effects to processing and calculating data on web pages with ease as well as providing extended 
	functionality to websites using third party scripts among several other handy features." </em><br><br>
	JavaScript does not require compiliation steps and all the work it does happens on your browser.  This means that it is quick
	and easy.  No complicated technical implementation things are required and when it does some of it's fancy interactive stuff it
	all happens in your web browser. This also has the advantage of reducing any work done by the server running your web site.<br> <br>
    Another good thing is that JavaScript is understood by any browser.  You don't have to worry about whether you have this web browser software or that browser
	software and which version you are running.  It is 'platform' independent.<br> <br>
	JavaScipt is very flexible and can do lots of cool things so that the user has a nice time and interacts happily with your web site.<br> <br>
    <h2>What are its limitations?</h2>
    JavaScript has a few weaknesses or limitations.  There is an issue with security because the JavaScript code executes on the users' computer, 
	in some cases it can be exploited for malicious purposes.  This is one reason some people choose to disable JavaScript. <br> <br>
	Although JavaScript is platform independent, sometimes it can be interpreted differently by different browsers. Whereas the alternative, server-side scripts will always produce the same output, 
	client-side scripts, like JavaScript, can be a little unpredictable. 	However, as long as your software works well in all the major browsers you should be safe.
