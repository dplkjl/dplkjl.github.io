	<h1>Welcome to my World</h1>
		<h2><strong>Who am I!</strong></h2>
		<p>I'm Karen. Writing things about myself is not my strong point.  I won't write too much at this point as I am really time short for this weeks tasks and need to move on quickly.</p>

			<h3>Work</h3>	
			<p>Currently I work in a small company called Data People Limited.</p>
		    <a href="http://www.datapeople.co.nz/"target="_blank">Data People Ltd</a> <br />
			<p> Work Email:<a href="mailto:karen@datapeople.co.nz"> karen@datapeople.co.nz</a> </p>

			<h4>What we do</h4>	
					<p>We specialise in the 
					design, development, implementation and support of customised database 
					applications. Our clients are largely not-for-profit and government 
					sector organisations and we have worked extensively with Iwi and other 
					Maori Social Service Providers. Data People Ltd has extensive experience 
					with the Microsoft Office suite of applications and we have used 
					Microsoft Access as our primary database development tool. More recently 
					we have moved towards the development of browser based applications 
					written using the Visual Studio suite in combination with SQL server.</p>
				
					<p>Many of our customers need database applications to store and report information about their client base and the work done with these clients. We have many customers who deliver social support services to their clients and need to report on a quarterly and annual basis to	their Funders. We have found Microsoft Access to be a powerful but inexpensive development tool which allows for fast and flexible database development and low implementation costs.</p>

		<p> </p>

		<h5><b>Why am I doing this!</b></h5>	
			<p>I have come enrolled in the <i> Dev Academy Boot Camp </i>to get out of the office and learn lots of new stuff.</p>	
		<h6>How is it going?</h6>	
			<p>It's a huge learning curve.  This is my first attempt at writing html.  Design also isn't my strong point. I think I have that scandinavian simplicity heritage that means I value simplicity and functionality over aesthetics.</p>
		<h4>My Interests</h4>
