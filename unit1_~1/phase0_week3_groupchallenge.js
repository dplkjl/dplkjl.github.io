// My role in the group is:
// Story Teller
// Here is my part of the challenge:

// What I want:
// I have in my possession a bunch of numbers.
// I want to add them all together.
// I also want to find their average.
// Finally, I want to be able to to find the median number 
// of that group of numbers. 
//-------------------------------------------------------
//-------------------------------------------------------
// My role in the group is:
// pseudo coder
// Here is my part of the challenge:

//create an array object called myNumbers
//create a function that loops through MyNumbers
//the function should use the array length property to determine how many times to loop and should start at 0 so that it can use this variable to match the array index
//inside the loop add the value from the array (that matches the index) to a myTotal variable
//return the value of myTotal from the function
//myTotal should then be divided by the number of elements in myNumbers array to give an average called myAverage
//then sort the array to order from smallest to largest number
//use an if statement to determine whether the length of the array has an odd or even number of elements by using modulo of 2
//if the modulo is not 0 then
//myMedian will be the value stored in array in the sorted position that is the (length of array / 2) + 1
//else myMedian will be the value stored in the position ((length of array / 2) + ((length of array / 2) + 1) / 2)  ie. add the middle two numbers in the sorted array and divide by 2
